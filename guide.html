<h2>A Short Guide to Independent Language Learning (1600 words)</h2>

<p>David Wilkinson, 20th April 2017</p>

<p>I am uneasy about giving advice on how to learn a language. There are many approaches and it&rsquo;s hard to make concrete arguments as to why one method is superior to another. What follows is personal perspective born of self-observation and experimentation over a decade of studying languages, mostly independently. First, a few principles:</p>

<p>Use your ears. Your objective, as a language student, is to acquire the ability to communicate in the language in question. That is to say: to be able to decode and produce the language. The fact we are able to swiftly perform this otherwise complex task is due to specific mental facilities, unique to our species (to our knowledge). It seems evident that these mental facilities are best trained using input in their native medium: speech. In my experience, working extensively with audible material is central to internalising the structures of the language. Wood pulp and ink (or pixels on a screen) are not an adequate substitute. Fluent reading is a somewhat separate skill that must build upon existing linguistic competency. If you have suitably prepared materials, or can practice regularly with a speaker, it is possible to learn to speak a language well without learning to read at all.</p>

<p>Learn by doing. Language, by its very nature, is a means, and not an end; it is best internalised not when it is explicitly studied, but rather when it is used to communicate, either in a living environment, or when we decode recorded language. Learning a language is less about logic or memorising rules than about acquiring a skill, or a set of habits. It has more in common with learning to play a sport than an academic pursuit.</p>

<p>Develop a tolerance for ambiguity. Accept that you will learn phrases without a complete knowledge of their grammatical workings. As you internalize a store of sentences, you will, over time, predictably deduce the same principles that are expounded in detail in a grammar manual. That&rsquo;s not to say grammar should be avoided, but to engage with a language, and start using it, the most basic notions will suffice. It&rsquo;s best to study grammar in detail at a later stage.</p>

<h3>Studying on your own</h3>

<p>The materials that are most useful can be categorised as such:</p>

<p>The first kind provide a &lsquo;sample&rsquo; or &lsquo;chunk&rsquo; of the language, with a translation or other means to support comprehension. In this category we can place bilingual books with stories or dialogues (preferably with good recordings), and films or television with suitable subtitles. If suitable materials are not available for the language you are studying, it is possible to create your own.</p>

<p>Such materials help the student to immediately engage with the language and get used to its logic. An important metric when selecting materials to study with is the volume of recorded material it includes. If your immediate goal is to speak the language, it&rsquo;s better to use source material that has a conversational, non-technical style.</p>

<p>The methodology for working with these materials is much the same. Center your studies around the recorded material. Try and understand as much as you can from the recordings before referring to the text. Listen to the recordings on their own sometimes. As you progress, what at first appears alien and incomprehensible will become more familiar and transparent. Pay attention to the sounds of the language, and imitate them as best you can. Studying the phonetics of a language is also encouraged.</p>

<p>Focus on phrases, rather than individual words. The best way to get feel for how a word is used is to meet it in various different linguistic contexts. As we progress through material, those words and structures that we come across most frequently, and thus the most important, will receive the most re-enforcement. It follows then that it is better to focus on consuming a hearty volume of material than spending a lot of time trying to understand the exact meaning of any single word. A dictionary is not essential for the language student. Resist the urge to translate the language literally into your own; this is to a impose an alien logic onto the words and is of limited use.</p>

<p>There are other techniques that can be used to more actively engage with the material. These include repeating the recording out loud (as you hear it), transcribing the text by hand, or reverse translating the text back into the language being studied.</p>

<p>The second kind of materials provide grammatical descriptions. As a beginner, it&rsquo;s useful and interesting to have an overview of the types of structures that you will encounter. A language has a number of grammatical concepts, and a lot of the space in a grammar book is often taken up by examining the edge cases where the scope of two concepts overlap, and how the boundary is drawn between them. Such cases can also be observed during contact with the language.</p>

<p>A third kind of materials are audiolingual drills. Here the student responds to recorded prompts and must produce a response, albeit in a limited and mechanical way. While these drills cannot prepare us for the skills of composition and spontaneous use of language, I have found working with them worthwhile. At the very least, the books typically include excellent and appropriate grammar descriptions, and the extensive recordings that can be used (especially when edited) for listening.</p>

<p>These materials can be used as a supplement to conversational practice, or alternatively, as a means of building a useful passive knowledge of the language, in the case no conversation partner is available. I recommend you visit smallworld.press for more advice, lists of recommended materials, and useful links. [Didn&rsquo;t set up site yet.]</p>

<p>Once you obtain a certain level of skill in the language, you are able to access media that is intended for normal consumption by native speakers. You are no longer dependent on learning materials. Now is perhaps a suitable time to develop your reading skills, if you wish.</p>

<h3>How to best make use of a speaker of the language</h3>

<p>If you aim is to be able to speak, then get speaking. You will need plenty of practice. Begin as soon as you have the opportunity.</p>

<p>If you hire a tutor, they may attempt to &lsquo;tutor&rsquo; you. That is to say, impart by explanation the principles of the language, in the expectation that you will somehow adapt this knowledge into a form that makes you a speaker of the language. What you need is a conversation partner; their job is provide you with a source of simple speech you can for the most part understand (using context and the occasional translation, if necessary), and to guide your foot to the next foothold as you shakily construct your responses.</p>

<p>Once you have a grasp on a handful of verbs in the present tense, a small vocabulary for the topics you are discussing, and a feel for how to construct sentences, you can begin. Talk about things going on in your life, construct stories, or bring along a newspaper and use the article headings as a stimulus for conversation. Try to express yourself using the simple words and structures you already know, limiting your requests for translations to when you can&rsquo;t find a way to get your point across. Pay attention to how your conversational partner expresses themselves, in their speech you will see illustrated the shortcuts (structures and vocabulary) that will allow you to communicate more succinctly.</p>

<h3>A Few More Tips</h3>

<p>If I were to begin the study of a language, I would divide my time between the following activities:</p>

<p>30% Working with (recorded) books/dialogues 30% Working with (recorded) pattern drills, if available 10% Reading Grammar explanations 30% Practicing with a speaker (ideally, but whatever you can get is beneficial)</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s important to study regularly, by making a habit of your studies. Find a quiet spot without distractions. By using the right materials and techniques combined with consistency, remarkable things can be achieved through self-study.</p>

<p>There are two milestones I find useful. The first: being able to discuss general topics with relative ease with a person who can accommodate their speech for you somewhat. You have mastered the most common structures of the language and have a vocabulary of perhaps 2-3000 words. At the second milestone, you can follow and participate in educated discussions on mostly any topic, and access any materials that are intended for a native speaker. You have a vocabulary of 8-12,000 words. While reaching this level doesn&rsquo;t come overnight, it&rsquo;s important to remember that as soon as you can get your point across, you are succeeding. From then on, it&rsquo;s a question of refinement.</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t be alarmed if you seem to reach a plateau in your learning. Linguistic knowledge, from the time we are first presented with new material, seems to need a period of incubation before it is made available for our use. Be sure to get enough sleep.</p>

<p>Lastly, it is important to remember that a foreign language is the vehicle of a foreign culture. To become a natural speaker of a language, you must learn not only how to say any given phrase in the language, but what to talk about, how to talk about it, how to compose your arguments using a different stock of concepts. You must, in effect, forge an alter personality for yourself. This, for many, will be the most enriching and rewarding reason to study a foreign language, and I wish you success.</p>
